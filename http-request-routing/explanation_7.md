It's the same implementation is in the autocomplete problem 5, the only  
difference is that words are used instead of a single character.  
Also in this problem some additional methods added to make sure an  
input data is valid.  

Space complexity: **O(n)** . Where n - number of words.     
Time complexity: lookup **O(log(n))**, add_handler **O(log(n))**.
